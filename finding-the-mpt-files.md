# Finding the MPT Files

After picking the python scripts, we can select our data folder. The button underneath selecting the python scripts should say "Select a folder." 

Right now, I advise having all the data in a single folder, because the Select a Folder function works on folders named "data." So you can either rename a folder to 'data,' or just consolidate all your data into a single place and make a new folder named 'data.'

Selecting it will display this.

Now we can select a file and load it
